//CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship  
//Project Report â€“ QuoteAnalyzer  

---------------------------------------------

1. Project Overview  
This project aims to extract, analyze, visualize, and derive insights from quotes collected from a public website. The main objectives were:  
- To scrape quotes data from http://quotes.toscrape.com/ using Python and BeautifulSoup.  
- To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the quotes and authors.  
- To visualize top authors and popular tags related to the quotes using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- To apply Sentiment Analysis on quotes text to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral using TextBlob.  

---------------------------------------------

2. Dataset  
- Source: Scraped data from the website http://quotes.toscrape.com/  
- Columns:  
  - Quote: The text of the quote.  
  - Author: Person who said the quote.  
  - Tags: Related keywords describing the quote.  
- Format: Stored as CSV file (quotes.csv) and updated with sentiment (quotes_with_sentiment.csv).  

---------------------------------------------

3. Web Scraping Process  
- Used Python requests library to fetch the HTML content of the webpage.  
- Used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract quote text, author name, and tags.  
- Organized extracted data into lists and saved into CSV.  
- Challenges: Handling pagination was kept minimal for simplicity; focused on first page quotes.  

---------------------------------------------

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Loaded the scraped data using pandas.  
- Checked data structure, missing values, and counted unique authors.  
- Identified most frequent authors and common tags to understand dataset distribution.  
- No significant missing data or anomalies found in this dataset.  

---------------------------------------------

5. Data Visualization  
- Created bar plots for:  
  - Top 10 authors with most quotes.  
  - Top 10 most frequent tags.  
- Visualization helped reveal that some authors dominate quote frequency and certain tags are very popular.  
- Used color palettes and proper labels for clear and attractive visuals.  

---------------------------------------------

6. Sentiment Analysis  
- Applied TextBlob for polarity-based sentiment classification on each quote.  
- Classified sentiments into Positive, Negative, or Neutral.  
- Summary of sentiment distribution showed majority of quotes were Positive or Neutral.  
- This analysis can help understand the overall mood or tone in quote datasets.  

---------------------------------------------

7. Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup4, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob.  
- Data saved and managed in CSV format for easy access and reusability.  

---------------------------------------------

8. Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the ability to scrape real-world data, conduct thorough data exploration,
produce insightful visualizations, and implement basic NLP techniques like sentiment analysis.
It provides a strong foundation in data-driven storytelling and analytics useful for business intelligence and research.
